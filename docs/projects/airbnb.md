# Airbnb replica

_Sep 2019_

![airbnb-screenshot](../projects/assets/airbnb-snap.png )

Link to the my [Airbnb replica website](https://airbnb-ly.herokuapp.com/) to play around. The code is on github, divided into [front-end](https://github.com/lydialawli/airbnb-react/) and the[ api](https://github.com/lydialawli/airbnb-api).

## Context

I attended a 2 month Fullstack development bootcamp this summer in Thailand.  
In the course, there were constantly new technologies and tools introduced to us. In order to apply all this tools in a real scenario we build the replica of the Airbnb platform. Each of us worked on our own version.

The goal of this project was to learn how to **build from scratch** the **front-end** and the **back-end**, how to connect both ends together, practice and improve our Javascript level, and also to learm how to use external api's and frameworks.

## Goal

Despite being a simulation of the real Airbnb platform, the functionalities and tools implemented in this pages are real.  
I am currently **still developing** it to improve my coding skills and it also serves me as a test app for my other ambitious projects.

It is also a way to showcase my programming abilities to whoever is interested in hiring me :)
