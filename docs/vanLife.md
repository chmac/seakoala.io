## My journey into van life 
![orxata4](/images/orxata4.jpg )

June 2017

### Context
 After many years of following what society had planned for her, Ly finally got the courage to stop, breathe and take things at her pace. Nice and slowly, but surely.

 In the summer of 2016, Ly finished her 3rd internship in Hong Kong, after a 4 years master degree in Animation. 
 While being immersed in the working routine of 8h job, taking several public transports in order to move around, the overwhelming lifestyle in the big city‚Ä¶  she felt a lot of responsibility to perform well without the actual space for it. 
She started climbing. Met her beloved partner and quickly realised that she was unable to follow the path that she set in front of her, because well, there were more choices.

After long on-going conversations, Ly and her partner decided to invest some time on the idea of living frugally and most importantly, off-grid.

### Motivation
Ly loved climbing, and exploring new places. A van would fullfill that desire in amazing ways. 

The idea of having a van with all the basic needs in it; bathroom, bed, storage place, kitchen‚Ä¶ was nice and a pretty awesome challenge for craftsman's like they thought they were.

It was important for them to build it instead of buying one done, as it would allow them to learn and also customise it exactly the way they wanted it.

Plus, it was more economical too.

But most importantly, they wanted freedom, the freedom of not being attached to a fixed place, the concept of living with the most minimum necessary things, the feeling that having less was in fact, much more!


## Before taking off

### Preparation face

#### Getting the van

![orxata1](/images/orxata1.png ) 
Ly‚Äôs partner went ahead to Valencia and picked up a second-hand **Citroen Jumper**. The tallest and largest they could have found. And the one that did not look to obvious that someone would be living there (as parking in a city was something they had planned to do). 

#### Setup workspace
Ly and her family had this property in a village close to Girona, where they had a small building (not really a proper house) and that served the job just fine. 
Though the place was ideal as far as space and isolation wise, it took extra effort to get it ready for being a "decent" work space. Basically then, they spent their first weeks cleaning and fixing the terrain (calling the "farm" from now on) instead of focusing on the van.

#### Buggy fithy van
As part of the risk of buying a second-hand vehicle, is well, the amount of rubbish and broken pieces that the buyer would hide from its advertisement (in order to get rid of it asap). It was undetectable through the images of the ad.

They found forks and knives and all kind of weird things and dead creatures, plus a lot of dirt‚Ä¶ 
Many parts of the metal were rusted and basically, not in an adequate condition to build anything on top of it (as humidity could eventually damage it even more).


So, anyways, they ended up spending a month and a half just "resurecting" the van. Madre mia!

### Brainstorming and design

They spent some energy replicating the van in a 3D visualisation so that they could play with the architecture of their ideal house. 

Here are some renders done in Rhinoceros 3D:

  <img src="src/orxata4.jpg" width="45%" /> 
</div>

#### key preference for design
- Wood for walls and ideally everything else too (to give warm cosy feeling)
- Fit a double bed
- fixed working table (for practicity)
- fixed bathroom with shower and toilet in
- screen holder
- popup table (for dinning for instance)
- a sink with proper drainage system 

## Building process
![orxata6](/images/orxata6.jpg ) 

Global steps were:
- cut and position windows (3 in total)
- stick main structure
- make holes on the ceiling (to pass cables for solar panels)
- add insolation 
- build bed structure
- build kitchen structure
- make specific window covers
- add leather in certain areas
- cut, sand and varnish frisos and other wooden material
- cover insolation with frisos
- create shower structure
- create water system
- create electrical system
- create shelves and other furniture
- setup solar panels and battery
- keep covering all the walls with frisos
- stick grey water container under the van
- cover floor with nice wooden panels (parquets)
- throw a fucking party 

(more info about the process coming soon...)

## Overall 

### Original goals and assumptions
- Thought it would take 2-3 months maximum.
- Expected to be fully off-grid also by then.
- Would have the necessary tools and money for the build.
- That things would be easy as their friend, internet, was by their side
...

### What ended up happening
The whole project ended up lasting a whole year (gee‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶)

**It slowed down** because:

- Van was in a worse shape than expected (had to clean and fix mechanical parts)
- Materials were not as easy to find
- Some pieces were bought online and weren't available at the time 
- Ideas where changing and evolving constantly
- Living far from the city was not convenient for shopping the material
- Prioritised other parts of life such as making money and family business
- Lack of good tools 
- Were unaware of the existence of electricity (on the farm) until 5 months later, so everything was done manually‚Ä¶
- And well, due to countless trial fails and lack of experience üòÖ

### But afterall...

It was such a long learning process for Ly. 
Not only from acquiring the skills of a craftsman, learning how to utilise certain tools, designing and playing with the creation of unexisting furniture, dealing with tough conditions...

![orxata3](/images/orxata3.jpg ) 

In fact, the hardest, most intense yet powerful experience was the commitment to make this project happen with a person who she‚Äôd met less than a few months before. And being determined to go through it until it was done.
Building a creative project while learning to live 24/7 with someone else, required a lot of communication skills, one that Ly was not really good at.

She struggled a lot in expressing her needs, desires and preferences. Probably she was not even able to connect with herself enough, and even less likely to articulate it to others.

Therefore, it was also a very effective way to challenge one‚Äôs own values and to get more insight and introspection. 

Ly felt she learned about her nature more than she ever had. 

At times it was like heaven, working and sweating next to your lover while both feeling grateful and filled with moments of laughter and big smiles.

And at times, it was even a lonely feeling. Ly had to deal with many insecurities and fears she did not even know she had. Those were tough moments, but after dealing with it, the water was calm again.

So, despite taking a year long effort to make it happen; it was one of the most enriching experiences she ever had, and one that she is not incredibly excited to repeat any time soon. 

The van is now called Orxata. The lovely creature that will take Ly and her lover to the most unexpected places in the world, and still making them feel exactly like home.
