## My journey into van life 

#### Context
 After many years of trying to please others and doing what Ly was "supposed" to do, she finally got the courage to stop, breathe and take things at her pace. Nice and slowly, but surely.

 In the summer of 2016, Ly finished her 3rd internship in Hong Kong, after a 4 years master degree in Animation. 
 While being immersed in the working routine of 8h job, taking several public transports to move around, the overwhelming lifestyle in the big city…  she felt a lot of responsibility to perform well without the actual space for it. 
She started climbing. Met her beloved partner and quickly realised that she was unable to follow the path that she set in front of her, because well, there were more choices.

After long on-going conversations, Ly and her partner decided to invest some time on the idea of living frugally and most importantly, off-grid.

#### Motivation
The idea of having a van with all the basic needs in it; bathroom, bed, storage place, kitchen… was nice and a pretty awesome challenge for craftsman's like we thought we were.

They wanted to build it themselves because well, bulding is learning, and learning is growing. 
Plus, it was way more economical than buying an already built camper van.

But most importantly, they wanted freedom, the freedom of not being attached to a fixed place, investing in buying a house (at such a young age) and getting trapped with the mortgage, the concept of living with the most minimum necessary things, the feeling that having less was in fact, much more!

## Prebuilding

#### Getting the van and setting up

Before starting the build, there was an earlier stage which was very important to do. The research of material, prices, tools and where to actually fit the van and work for it for at least several months straight. 

Place wise, it was simple. Ly and her family had this property in a village close to Girona, where they had a small building (not really a proper house) and that served the job just fine. 

While they were doing all that research, Ly’s partner went ahead to Valencia and picked up a second-hand Citroen Jumper. The tallest and largest they could have found. And the one that did not look to obvious that someone would be living there (as parking in a city was something they had planned to do). 

After setting up the place in the property, let’s call it “farm” for ease, they quickly noticed how bad and filthy the van was, in and out… it looked like someone had a big dusty party in it and left all the shit inside without caring about it at all. 
They found forks and knives, and a lot of dirt… Many parts of the metal were rusted and basically, not in an adequate condition to build anything on top of it.

So, anyways, they ended up spending a month and a half just “cleaning” the van. 

They were very ambitious back then, thinking that it would last only 3-4 months maximum. Sure...


#### Brainstorming and design

Both Ly and her partner were sort of designers (sort of because they weren’t professional as in earning money from it), so they spent some effort in replicating what the van in a 3D model so that they could play with the architecture of their ideal house. 

Her partner ended up rendering this (using Rhinoceros):  

<div float="left" width="100%">
  <img src="src/orxata1.jpg" width="45%" />
  <img src="src/orxata2.jpg" width="45%" /> 
  <img src="src/orxata3.jpg" width="50%" /> 
  <img src="src/orxata4.jpg" width="45%" /> 
</div>

Wood was a must for both of them, as they wanted a warm and homie kind of feeling.
