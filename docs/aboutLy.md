Ly is a constant dreamer and experience-seeker. 
Loves creating things, learn and connect with other lovely souls out there. 
Was born in Girona, Spain, but raised by beloved Hong Kong family.
Ly is emotional, empathetic, active and odd.

Shapeless, just like water. Will adapt to new surroundings, but is naturally going to change into something different.

Studied her masters in 2D 3D Animation production and currently learning to program. 



## What is Ly doing now?
Creating her second mobile app called [Evok](https://github.com/lydialawli/Evok). Trying to figure out whether software engineering is the way to go. 
[Ilustrating](https://seakoala.io/#/docs/art/allArt) and testing different styles.
In her free most favourite time, she is either rock climbing, reading, running or swimming.

## Why Seakoala? and why Ly?
Ly is short for Lydia. 
It's pronounced "Lee". Close friends and family call her Ly. 

Seakoala is some joke that started together with her partner. 
They discuss often about what a perfect world would look like in our eyes. One clear thing is that there would be amazing colors everywhere. We call it "Uniworld". 

And what's up with Seakoala üê®? Well, Ly loves water, and being immersed in it, anyone who knows her enough definitely is aware of it. And koala is because she like hugs and cuddles, who doesn't? 

Ah, and she is a professional sleeper too ü§§
