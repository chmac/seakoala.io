# One man's short story

1 oct 2019

---
#### INSTANCE 1: existence/ just being

<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man is seeing suntime, therefore experiencing suntime.  
Man cannot experience moontime, because he is asleep when it‚Äôs there.  

Hence, Man is only aware of the existence of suntime, not moontime. 
</br>
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 2: awareness

<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />

Man is awake at night, so he sees moontime, therefore experiencing and knowing its existence.  
Man can experience one of them at a time. Man only has its present moment, not memory of the past at all.  
Man is still aware of only one of the two sides. Not both at the same time.

Hence Man is aware of the time which is in front of him.
</br>
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 3: neurons

<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man is now able to keep one instance back in his memory.  
The instance of this memory keeps changing, as it keeps changing from suntime to moontime and like this an infinite loop.  
Man can only keep two things in his head, the present, say suntime, and the previous instance, moontime.  
Man knows that previous instance is moontime because it was in his memory, not because things can only be this two ways.  
Man knows about 2 types of times, but doesn‚Äôt know what else to do with it so it is meaningless.

Hence Man is aware of suntime and moontime existence, but unaware of correlation.
</br>
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 4: synapsis

<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man suddenly, after a long time just being captivated by observing moontime and suntime consecutively, realises a whole different thing, a sparkle.  
Man starts having sparkles more and more often and more intense.  
Man suddenly is aware of this sparkles, he knows that it will come again after one just happened.  
Man keeps being mesmerised by the nature of both sides.  
Man knows 3 things now: suntime, moontime and sparkles.  

Hence Man is very curious now. He experiences change.
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 5: rhythmic action potentials

<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man notices a pattern: ‚Äúsuntime, always comes after a sparkle, and moontime...too‚Äù.  
Man discovers the rhythm; ‚Äúsuntime, sparkle, moontime‚Äù. Again ‚Äú ‚Äúsuntime, sparkle, moontime and then sparkle, and suntime, and sparkle and moontime....‚Äù.  
Man is unaware of other possibilities, only this exact pattern.  
Man is entertained, as usual.  
‚ÄúSparkle, suntime, sparkle, moontime, sparkle, suntime‚Ä¶‚Äù.  

Hence Man is super excited now, starts to want to know more!
</br>
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 6: neural network

<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man gets tired and sleepy at suntime for the first time, he falls asleep.  
Man wakes up accidently in moontime, and can‚Äôt go to sleep again.  
Man feels weird, ‚ÄúI am awake and it should be suntime‚Äù.  
Man has the idea, the belief, that suntime should be there.  
Man‚Äôs mind, together with the memory of the past experiences and learnings, are finally useful! Man knows!
</br>
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 7: desires

<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man gets better, things get back to normal, suntime, spark, and then, after suntime always comes moontime.  
Man feels happy about knowing this, knowing the future.  
Man is proud of feeling smart.  
Man challenges himself to predict the future a few steps ahead: he designs the paper and a while after, the calculator.  
Man starts writing down the sequence and then making sure to test them out and keep feeding his ego by proving himself he is right.  
Man designs an algorithm that will predict the future without his help. Man automates the system.  
Man is now free from needing to know about the future and constantly calculating the next few steps, as his fancy tech, the AI will let him know.  
Man is bored, man feels useless, man is not proud of himself anymore. Man is depressed and hopeless.  
Man cries dry tears.  
Man feels like dying is better.  
</br>
</br>

#### INSTANCE 8: mindfulness

<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man looks around and finds no one, nothing, just him and suntime and moontime again.  
Man gets distracted by the familiarity of suntime and moontime.  Forgets that he is sad.  
Man remembers that he had a previous job or just something to do which was not crying and building algorithms.  
Man goes back to his initial position and breathe in and out deeply, and just becomes the Man staring at suntime and moontime again.  
Man is aware that this is and will always be his innate way of being.   Man knows about roller coasters and the law of impermanence, of equanimity.

Man is alive, he exists, he knows, he accepts.
