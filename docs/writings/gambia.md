# The Gambia 

Feb 2019

---

## Introduction
First time travelling to this country. Spent 7 days there. 
Kept a little notebook so Ly could write down all the curious and strange things that she notices about this foreign land. 

## Pre travel preparation
- Had to book a doctor‚Äôs appointment to get vaccinated for the [Yellow Fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever). </br>
(Since recently, a single dose provides a **life-long** protection against the disease. Yay!)
- Bought **Malaria Pills**, assigned by the doctor. Was recommended to take it a week before arrival to The Gambia.
- No need for VISA if you are European (things could change though)

## Good to know
- Locals call The Gambia simply by ‚ÄúThe River‚Äù. 
- Banjul is the capital city, but Serekunda is the largest urban center.
- Smallest country in mainland Africa. Also it‚Äôs literally inside Senegal, which is another country.
- Farming, fishing and tourism is what their economy is based on.
- Used to be part of British Colony so **English** is actually the official language of the country. Other main languages are **Mandinka**, **Fula** and **Wolof** (similar to Senegal, though Senegal was taken by French Colony). 
Some minority also speak **French**.
- Currency: **Gambian Dalasis** (1‚Ç¨ = 56.5 GMD ~)
- Religion: **95% Islam** and 4% Christianism
- Cuisine: must try Yassa and **Domoda** (peanut stew, Ly‚Äôs favourite! üòã). </br>
 Main used ingredients are: peanuts, rice, fish, meat, onions, tomatoes, cassava and chilli peppers. Abundance of chicken but of course, no pork (no haram meat).
- Transport: **Green taxi** (tourist, private, insured, fixed charges, price posted on boards usually)  and **Standard Yellow taxi** (what locals use, cheapest method, can be tricky if you are disoriented person like Ly, better study the map a little bit, costs **8 Dalasis per area**, say if you travel to 2 different areas on the same trip, you pay 8 Dalasis, twice ). </br>
There are other types of transport, check out this [web](http://www.accessgambia.com/information/taxis.html) for more info.
- They drive on the right side of the road.
- Weather: it's a sub-tropical country, so it's **summery** all year long between 29¬∞C and 34¬∞C. 
    **Rainy seasons** are July until September. Mosquitos are abundant then.
- Gambians are very **peaceful and friendly humans**. They seem to **avoid rushing** and getting into trouble.
