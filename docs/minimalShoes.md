## Introducing minimal shoes

Around 2016, Ly was first introduced to the idea of running and walking with "minimal shoes", or even barefoot.

She then read [_Born to Run_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen), by Christofer McDougall, and got super motivated to give it a try. Since then, it has become her preference pair of shoes for her daily life. 




Here is Ly's attempt to simplify the steps in a visual way:
