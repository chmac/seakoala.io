## Introducing minimal shoes
![ly-running-refined](/images/ly-running.png )

Around 2016, Ly was first introduced to the idea of running and walking with "minimal shoes", or even barefoot.

She then read [_Born to Run_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen), by Christofer McDougall, and got super motivated to give it a try. Since then, it has become her preference pair of shoes for her daily life. 

## Ly's conclusion using huaraches

### Benefits
- can run longer distances without hurting the knee
- body goes back to walking "properly" 
- feet gets eventually stronger and stronger
- more body awareness
- much cheaper than usual shoes
- fast to wear
- occupies close to nothing

### Challenges
- must be extra careful with the steps
- may get damaged or in need of fixes every now and then
- cannot run as fast and "jumpy" as when using classic sport shoes
- does not protect you from the cold, so extra (five finger) socks are incredibly useful
- might get a lot of stares (which isn't really a problem)

## Making your own minimal shoes
Here is Ly's attempt to simplify the steps in a visual way:
