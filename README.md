# Seakoala 

All about Ly will be shown here. 

## Ly in 10 seconds
I consider myself an artist, constant learner and an experience-seaker.

Asian looking Spanish-Catalan active lady raised by beloved Chinese- Hong Kong parents. 

I am emotional, empathetic, active and odd. I'd like to see myself as humble too. (My mum made sure to include this symbol in my chinese name).

Have a masters degree in 2D 3D Animation production, not sure is relevant currently. 


## What is Ly doing now?
Currently working in an Educational startup.
Creating my own app called Evok. 
Drawing and ilustrating life. 
Rock Climbing whenever she can.
Running with awesome minimal shoes. 
Reading a Geek In Japan, Shantaram and Thinking Fast and Slow.   

## Pass achievements 
Here's the section where I'll post all the things/achievements that I consider worth remembering.

I used to get depressed often because I would get into this dark rabbit holes of negative thoughts, feeling useless and unsuccesful. So this section is partiulary important to remind myself that is pointless to compare so much with others and focus on where I actually have arrived compared to years ago. It's a little self-motivation guide for Ly. 

## Why Seakoala? and why Ly?
My name is Lydia, but Ly is my artist name. The reason is because it's short, precise and cute. 
It's pronounced "Lee". Close friends and family call me Ly. 

Seakoala is some joke that started together with my partner. 
We discuss often about what a perfect world would look like in our eyes. One clear thing is that there would be amazing colors everywhere. We call it "Uniworld".
I will write about it in more detail in the future, since I think its a pretty awesome concept. 

And as why on Earth I am a Seakola? Well, I love water, and being inmersed in it, anyone who knows me enough definitely is aware of it. And koala is because I like hugs and cuddles, who doesn't? 

Ah, and I am an awesome sleeper too.
